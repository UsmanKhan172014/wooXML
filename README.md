# wooXML
This is just a template which allows the users to simply import their products from any XML feed
and all the magic happens here.
What you need to do is put this template on the given path<br>
<code>public_html/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/templates</code><br>
and add the url in that <code>$url</code> variable
and then while adding a page just select the template
and you are all done.
Now what you need to do is navigate to the page you just created with the template selected<br>
<b>Note: in our case the template name is Example Template</b>
